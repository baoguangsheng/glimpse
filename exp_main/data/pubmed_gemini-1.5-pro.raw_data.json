        "Question: Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis? Answer: Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the \"early\" versus \"late\" prodrome model. It also indicates that",
