In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" When it comes to writing, starting can often be the most challenging part. The blank page can be daunting, but it's important to remember that every masterpiece began with a single word. \n\nOne approach is to simply put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) and let the words flow, without censoring or judging yourself. Allow your thoughts to spill out naturally, and worry about refining and editing later. Another technique is to start with an outline or a list of key points you want to cover, providing a roadmap to guide your writing. Alternatively, you could try freewriting, setting a timer and writing continuously without stopping, letting your subconscious take the lead. Whichever method you choose, the key is to silence your inner critic and embrace the process", "sampled_crit": -1.0083777904510498}, {"original": "And now.... We dance.
