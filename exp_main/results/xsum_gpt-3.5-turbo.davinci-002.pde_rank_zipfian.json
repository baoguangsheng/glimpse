Some believe it was the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper and that it has healing powers. It was stolen in 2014 before being returned to its owners a year later. It has now been donated to the library in Aberystwyth where thousands of people are expected to view it over the coming months. Pedr ap Llwyd, director of collections and public programmes, said visitors would finally be able to view the \"mysterious object\". \"This is truly a remarkable object and a very interesting addition to the national collections.\" The cup is claimed to have been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea after the death of Christ and then taken to Nanteos Mansion by seven monks from Strata Florida, Ceredigion, during the reign of Henry Vlll. The house was then owned by the Powell family and, after the monks died, they took possession of it for centuries.
