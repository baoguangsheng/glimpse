The daring heist took place at Brussels Airport, where a group of armed robbers intercepted a truck carrying the precious gems worth an estimated $50 million.\n\nThe thieves, dressed in police uniforms and toting machine guns, forced their way onto the tarmac and gained access to the Brink's armored truck. They then transferred the diamonds from the truck to their getaway vehicles and fled the scene. The entire operation lasted only a few minutes, leaving airport officials and security personnel stunned.\n\nAuthorities have launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators, but so far, no arrests have been made. The brazen robbery has raised concerns about security measures at airports and the transportation of high-value cargo.", "sampled_crit": 0.12283778190612793}, {"original": "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson.
